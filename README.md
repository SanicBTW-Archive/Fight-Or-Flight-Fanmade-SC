# Attempt to rebuild Fight or Flight from Sonic.EXE v3 cancelled build

All credits to the Sonic.exe team (reused sprites, v2.5 menu, basically everything)

This was built using 0.3.2h and the Main Menu State code from v2.5, no v3 source code was used aside from the LUA script that comes in the song folder in the cancelled build
